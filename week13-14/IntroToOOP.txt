Intro to OOP
	Classes

	A class is a custom datatype

3 things you define abt a class:

1. State: charateristics "data" (Also called encapsulation or data hiding)
2. Behavior: methods
3. How its born: constructors

Public vs. Private

	Private can only be access from within that class

	Public can be access from anywhere
	
	
Making a Circle

State:
	1) center
		x cord.
		y cord.
	2) radius
	
behavior:
	1) get the circumference
	2) get the area
	3) describe the circle
	4) get the radius
	4a) get the diameter
	5) get the center
	6) test whether a given point is in or on the outside of the circle or on the border
	7) set the radius to a given value
	8) move the circle by a given change x or change y
	9) set the location of the center to a new (x,y)
	
constucting a circle:
	a) default: unit circle centered at (0,0)
	b) custom constuction: specifiy a radius and a center
	c)
