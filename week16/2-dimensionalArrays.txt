2-dimensional arrays:

	square arrays: (3x3) 3 by 3 amt of rows = amt of columns Examples: tic tac toe
	rectangle arrays: (3x4) 3 by 4 amt of rows != amt of colums Examples: Seating arrangements on a plan
	ragged arrays: number of colums changes on each row (dont need to know)

to create a 2-dimnesional array
	int[][] mat = new int[3][4]; intialized to 0

	to specify a specific element: mat[1][2] = 7; would make that element a 7

	double[][] dmat = new double[2][3]; a 2-dim. double with 2 rows and 3 colums. Intialized to 0.0

	int[][] mat1 = {{1,2,3},{4,5,6},{7,8,9}}

to go through each element: GENERAL WORKS FOR EVERY 2 - Dimensional array

method 1 (regular for loops):
	for (int row = 0; row < mat1.length; row++) // to find the amt of rows u can use nameofarray.length
	{
		for(int col = 0; col < mat1[row].length; col++) // to find the amt of colums u can use nameofarray[row#].length
		{	// whatever you want to do for each element }
	}
method 2 (enhanced for loops):
	for(int[] row: mat1)
	{
		for (int i: row)
		{	//do something }
	}
